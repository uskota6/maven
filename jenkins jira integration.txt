:-we need to  do comment on project or on the relevant tickets.
	for this sake jenkins provided a plugin that actually integrate your jira with your jenkins so whenever you need to update any ticket that is relevant to any builds.
	Then you can update it
	for taht first we need to install a plugin in jenkins go to manage jenkins go to manage plugins in the manage plugins you would you would need to go to the available section and search for a plugin called jira.	
For that why you need to install.
	we would need this plug-in uh there are using this at project level so we need toinstall this plug-in after the installation the second thing you need to do is you need to create your access token for this go to your account from which you want to update the ticket i have already account.
	 so what i need to do is i need to go to theavatar of my profile and then go to the account settings in the account setting i would need to create a access key i need to go to the security and need to create a api token and here from here i can create a api token and i can give it give it a name as jira jenkins this is a friendly name you can give any name.
	then you can copy it and then i need to go to the jenkins again manage jenkins after the installation of the plugin in the configure system we need to search for jira we need to add a side from here we need to click on the jiraand then first we need to secure our token somewhere eventually i need to rebuild that token here in the url jira url you you would need to provide your server url just copy and paste it.

	you uh we don't need to change anything if we have issue pattern then we cancdefine over here otherwise we can leave it we can update to check on update relevant jira issue for all bills and now we need to supply credentials for this we need to supply the username and password we can  name this here we need to specify the email address that we're going to use for login to jira cloud in our case uh database is 911 at gmail.com password is the api key that i copied from uh from the token and then id could be anything i'm saying jenkins jira so i need to add it from here i need to select jenkins jira this is this is the credentials now i need to validate the settings if everything goes well i can see the success now i can save this next thing i would need to do is i need to go to my project that i gonna test with before that i need to create a ticket at least so i'm going to clear goto my project and i'm creating a ticket integrate jira and jenkins with this ticket as  i can assign it to me and then create and now i need to note the ticket number now i need to go to the jenkins uh jira that this is the project i'm gonna use for update the tickets the next thing uh here you can you could see the jira sites itall are automatically available.

	if you have multiple site it will be listed in the in this particular down drop down next thing i need to add some post will action so i'm saying okay update update the ticket i just need to find the option i could not see update jira ticket okay this is uh this is the option i was looking for in the selector section i need to select the explicit here i need to specify the ticket number that i would like to update and then i just need to save it after this i need to go to the build and click on the build now if i go to the console output it says updating issue on your ticket if i go to the ticket which is you are project so here is your ticket so from here i can see that message from jira and if i click over here i will be redirected to the build that sends actually the message to the jira so this is how you can integrate your tickets if you have multiple tickets like a relevant ticket to this build like go to the configure and i would like to update one more ticket with the same comment on like i have another ticket you are ticket dash fiveso i want to update whenever the buildis uh built run i want to run update both tickets there.
